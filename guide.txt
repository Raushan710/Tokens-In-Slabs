To use the above smart contract, you will need to deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using a Ethereum wallet or a tool like Remix.

Here is a brief guide on how to use the contract:

Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain. This will create an instance of the contract that you can interact with.

Call the "Deposite" function to deposit token. The function takes the number of tokens to be added as an input.

Call the "inquire" function to check which slab has tokens present. The function takes the address of the token as an input and returns slab numbers.

Some of the features implemented in the contract include:

1.Define 5 slabs with capacity for each [say Slab0â€¦.Slab4 having 100,200,300,400 and 500 as capacity
2. When a ERC20 token of specific type is deposited, it occupies the highest level and if the capacity reaches the maximum, it goes to the next lower level
3. When the depositor enquires, it states which slab the deposit is.
