This solidity files contain only one smart contract named "addTOken", which performs the action of adding tokens
to different slabs accroding to the slab capacity and and remaining space in the current slab.

Decisions taken are:

1."tokenslabs" is an arrray of 5 elements which contains numbers from 100, 200, 300, 400, 500;

2. "Totalsupply" is the number of tokens which have been added since contract deployment.
 
3. "slabCapacities"  shows the capacities of slab.
 
4.There are only two function :
 "Deposite"  and "inquire" which is used to deposit token and inquire the slabs where they are present.
